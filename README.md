# Analysis of No-Show Appointments
Why do patients miss their scheduled appointments?

Missed appointments lead to inefficient use of medical practitioners' time,
disruption to the clinic workflow, increased waiting periods
and can hinder optimal care.

This project analyzes and explores the factors that may contribute to a patient
not showing up to a scheduled medical appointment.

### Dataset
There are 110,527 records, each of 14 columns  appointment information from Brazil.
The dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

#### Questions that will be explored are:
1. Do certain age groups or genders tend to miss appointments?
2. Are appointments more likely missed on certain days (just before or
after the weekend)?
3. Does longer lead-time (the time between the day the appointment is scheduled
and the actual appointment date) correlate with higher incidence of no-shows,
maybe due to forgetfulness or recovery
4. Do sms reminders help lower the incidence of no-shows?
5. Are welfare holders likely to attend an appointment for fear of
possibly losing welfare entitlement due to too many missed medical appointments,
or are non-welfare holders more likely to attend an appointment as they would
possibly have to pay a no-show fee out of their own pocket.
6. Could a patient's physical traits affect their ability to show up to their
appointment?  Are patients with handicaps or suffering from alcoholism more
likely to be a no-show due to inability and incapacity to attend their appointment?
